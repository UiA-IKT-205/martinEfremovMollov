ToDoList (Prosjektoppgave I)

## Description

This app was developed as part of our first project task in IKT205. It is developed using the programming language Kotlin as well as Firestore as its backend database. It contains two screens (activities) where the first one is an overview of all the categories and the second one is detailed overview of all tasks that are in a particular category.

## Project status

Currently the app works as intended. The only known bug, as of now, is when a user deletes all done tasks the progress bar goes to 100, however when you check and uncheck an item it goes back to normal. This is being fixed in the next commit.
