Prosjektoppgave II

## Description

This app was developed as part of our second project task in IKT205. It is developed using the programming language Kotlin and it uses the Generic Game Service provided by our course teacher. It has three screens (activities) where the first one is a strting screen where the user can either create or join a game, the second one is the game activity itself and the third one is the win screen.

## How It Works

First, the user has to choose whether they want to create or join a game. If they decide to create a game they need to enter a player ID after which the game is creted and the user is now in the Game Activity. There they have the Game ID and all the players who have joined the game.

If they choose to join a game, they are asked to enter their player ID of choise and the game ID of an already created game.

After a win or draw the user/s are presented with a win screen where it is shown which player won the game or just "Draw!" if no one won.
